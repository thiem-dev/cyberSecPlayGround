# Things I learned
- This was my first major CTF. Did a lot of other CTF like MetaCTF monthly and old PicoCTFs prior. 
- Don't give up, jump around and let the problem cook in your head, sometimes a solution comes when you're dreaming in terminal or shower thoughts on a creative angle into a problem. 
- I need to LEARN MORE ASSEMBLY and pwntool memory overflows. 
- I got to try out Binary Ninja and Ghidra to reverse engineer and tried my best to interpret assembly and how to use such powerful tools.
- I gathered lots of wordlists and a web scrapers and hashing

# Tools I learned more about in this CTF

- Web 
  - Burp suite - sniper attacks / enums, XSS, SSRF, cookie spoofing
  - JWT forging
  - OWASP Zap - enums, vulnerability levels
  - socket connections in python
- Forensics
  - Steghide
  - Stegsolve
  - Wireshark
- Crytpo
  - There's more than just base64 encoding
  - OTP
  - XOR encryption
  - Did you know there is a programmer section to Window's calculator?
  - New Tools: basecrack, foremost
- Reverse Engineering
  - Binary Ninja - live debug and stepping through program execution
  - Ghidra - web assembly code and memory inspection


## Tools that were most used in this CTF

- lots of files in here use
  - basecrack
  - CyberChef, heavy base64, XOR
  - binwalk, foremost?, 
  - wireshark
